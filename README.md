# Flutter Firebase Example Application
Example application for the course 208.1 â€“ Mobile development summer school

## Description
The demo app was written with Flutter and uses Firebase's Firestore Database to store tasks and
Firebase Authentication to verify the user. In the app, the user is prompted to log in initially. If no
login is available, a new account can be created. Once logged in, the user sees the tasks they have
created and can create, delete or update new tasks. The app was written to give an initial idea of
how to use Flutter and Firebase.
